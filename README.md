# ðŸ§Š Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver â€“ Python + OpenCV

A computer visionâ€“based Rubikâ€™s Cube solver built using Python, OpenCV, and the Kociemba algorithm. This project captures the cube faces via webcam, detects colors using HSV thresholding, and computes the optimal solution using the `kociemba` library.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Uses OpenCV to capture cube face colors via webcam.
- Detects sticker colors using HSV values and maps them to standard cube notations.
- Computes an optimal solving sequence using the Kociemba 2-phase algorithm.
- Includes visual reference for cube notations (`cube notations.jpg`).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV (`cv2`)** â€“ for camera feed and color detection
- **kociemba** â€“ for solving the cube algorithmically

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Capture**:
   - The script uses your webcam to scan each face of the cube.
   - Captures are processed to read the center pixel of each sticker area.

2. **Detect Colors**:
   - Colors are detected using HSV thresholding.
   - Each color is mapped to a cube face letter (e.g., R, G, B, W, O, Y).

3. **Solve**:
   - Once all 6 faces are scanned, the sticker string is passed to the `kociemba.solve()` function.
   - It returns an optimal solution in standard Rubik's notation.

## ðŸ“· Webcam Setup

Make sure your webcam is working. If you have multiple webcams, you can modify the index here:

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change 0 to 1 or 2 if needed
